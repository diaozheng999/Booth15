# squashy


Squashy is a game developed by Simon Diao, Matthew Lee and Bryan Lee as part of a Spring Carnival Booth exhibit organised by the Singaporean Student's Association at CMU (SSA).

The game is set in the universe of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince", and in it the player uses a plastic shovel (with a magnet attached to its back) to "dig" up the roots of Baobab trees, which if left unattended, would populate the surface of the planet in no time.

To accomplish this project, we wrote most of our software in Actionscript 3.0, and made use of serproxy to establish connection with an Arduino, which we connected to a custom-made game board with Hall sensors to detect movement from the magnet embedded into the plastic shovels.
